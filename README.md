## Automation Test
In order for us to better assess your understanding and use of page objects, frameworks, test cases and coding we ask that you write tests for the following problems. If unable to create a framework write the tests in scripts. Upload to your github/bitbucket or return to us in a zip file. Include instructions on how to setup and run the tests.
1. Write all tests you think necessary for the following form: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login
